    <h2>Hi, my name is Jesse.</h2>

    <div id="column1">
    <p id="aboutpage">
      I am a 31-year-old hobbyist who has been enjoying working with images since I was 11 years old. My curiosity of
      image design originates from the early 2000s of the web, where I spotted interesting graphical signatures being
      displayed on website forums. My first professional application used at the time was Adobe Photoshop 7. Over
      multiple
      years, I would also take an interest in web design and designing simple templates and splicing them.
      
    </br>
      </br>
      At the age of 17, I had a friend who asked me if I could edit her photos in Photoshop. While I never really edited
      photography, this was a massive discovery that my post-processing experience in Photoshop could translate to photo
      retouch. For the next few months and onward, I would delve into the image correction world. I began to find a lot
      of
      enjoyment retouching photos and took any opportunity to edit when I could.
      </br>
      </br>
      But then I thought to myself: why don’t I just get the images myself? This was the pivotal moment where I decided
      that I wanted to purchase a DSLR for myself. I would save up for almost a year at my part-time job at Best Buy, in
      hopes to buying a proper camera for myself. Then, in December of 2011, I bought my first DSLR ever: the Canon T3i.
      </br>
      </br>
      I would hit the ground running, learning every facet of photography that I could. I was slowly convincing myself
      that photography could be a career for myself. In 2013, I enrolled myself into a B.F.A. of Photography at Barry
      University, a private liberal arts school located in Miami. At this point in time, photography became my entire
      life. After three semesters of my Photography degree, I realized that things just did not feel right anymore and
      withdrew from Barry.
      </br>
      </br>
      Pursuing a possible career in photography is what taught me that it should just be a passionate hobby of mine,
      instead of a career. Most recently, returning to shooting photography in my free time has reinvigorated my passion
      to being behind the lens.
      </br>
      </br>
      Photography is a beautiful form of art that allows a person to capture a specific moment in time, where it can be
      timelessly archived. And that’s what I’m here to do – documenting unforgettable memories.
